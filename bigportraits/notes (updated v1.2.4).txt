The contents of this folder are converted by the autocompiler.

V1.2.4

After compiling [character]_none.png, open [character]_none.xml in a text editor.

Change the Element name to "[character]_none_oval.tex". (Do not change the Texture filename)


This is in order to get the portrait to show up in the character inspect window. 
If you edit the image afterwards, you will have to repeat this after it re-compiles.



Example:
<Atlas>
	<Texture filename="esctemplate_none.tex" />
	<Elements>
		<Element name="esctemplate_none_oval.tex" u1="0.0009765625" u2="0.9580078125" v1="0.36181640625" v2="0.99951171875" />
	</Elements>
</Atlas>
